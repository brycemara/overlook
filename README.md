## Hotel California (Overlook)
[Bryce Jarrett](https://github.com/brycemara)

Final Project, Turing FE Course Mod 2

### Introduction
Welcome to the Hotel California! This application can be used by both a manager and a customer, just input the correct information on login.

As a customer, you will be able to see your total amount spent at the hotel, your bookings (past and future), and search available rooms by date and room type. You may also cancel future bookings & book a room for your next vacation!

As a manager, you will be displayed the total revenue for today as well as the percent your hotel is occupied. You are also given the ability to search customer bookings and cancel or book rooms for them. Don't forget to follow all Covid-19 rules.

### Goals
- Solidify and demonstrate my understanding of:
  - DRY JavaScript
  - using GET, POST & DELETE with fetch API's
  - Chai Spies Testing

- Work on problem problem solving small issues with tools like console.log() and debuggers.


### Tools
- JavaScript
- HTML
- SCSS/SASS
- Unit Testing
- Chai Spies Testing
- fetch
- github
- Google

### Challenges
The greatest challenge I faced in this project was re-fetching my data after it had been altered with a POST or DELETE. I overcame this by working with class mates, trying multiple different ways, and reviewing our fetch API lesson.
Other challenges involved manipulating the DOM and understanding how JavaScript was interpreting my code.

### Wins
I was able to successfully re-fetch data and display the updated data to my user. I was also able to create a Parent Class that helped enormously with giving both the manager and customer the same functionality.
The application is fully functional and meets all requirements of the project spec.

### Reflections / Lessons Learned
Working with fetch for the first time is challenging when trying to understand the asynchronous nature of JavaScript. I was able to successfully understand the concept and implement it in this project after multiple hours of question marks surrounding my head.

If I had more time with my Hotel California application I would like to make the UI experience better. I would also like to implement better alert messages when a room was booked or canceled. A message like "Would you like to continue?", "Are you sure you want to cancel?", "Would you like to upgrade for X amount of dollars?".

Multiple index.html files would also be something I'd look into but was out of the scope of this project.  

### Final Outcome
When being directed to the Hotel California page you will be prompted to login:
Please login as a manager or customer, if you input incorrect information you will be given an error alert.
